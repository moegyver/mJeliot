README for SOURCE Distribution

The source distribution includes the necessary files to build Jeliot. Jeliot is
currently being developed using Eclipse. Thus, we recommend importing the 
archive to Eclipse, though IntelliJ IDEA and others should work as well.

Documents found the doc folder are the latex files for the different manuals.Of 
special interest take a look at doc/soft_doc for a brief software 
documentation. Documents found in src/doc are those to be included in the 
binary distribution of Jeliot, i.e. basic help and distribution licenses.

Lib contains the libraries needed for the building of the different binaries. 
kunstoff.jar is for the Kunstoff Look and Feel, mostly used to let the user
change the font size of programs. bluejext.jar is needed to create the bluej
plugin. And the avinteraction.jar is needed for the Question generation during
animation.
