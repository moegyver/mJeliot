\section{Extending \jel{} System}
\label{sec:Extending_Jeliot_System}

\jel{}~3 is based on the idea that the interpreter and the visualization engine are separated with an intermediate code of the program execution. This allows the extension of the system by creating new visualization for the intermediate code. This section tries to help the extension or the modification of \jel{}~3 if that is needed. Currently, we have not added any subsection here for the extensions.
